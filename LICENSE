ADDITIONAL RESEARCH & ATTRIBUTION TERMS (Project Goliath)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the software is licensed under MIT, its use in the field of computational 
number theory regarding the Beal Conjecture is subject to the following 
attribution requirements:

1. PRIZE & PUBLICATION CREDIT: If this software or any derivative work is used 
   to discover a counterexample to the Beal Conjecture, or to establish new 
   lower bounds, the user agrees to credit "Project Goliath" and its author (Rynaldo stoltz) 
   in any resulting publication, press release, or prize claim.

2. COORDINATED DISCLOSURE: In the event of a potential hit (A^x + B^y = C^z), 
   the user agrees to coordinate the announcement with the project maintainers 
   to ensure the proof is cross-verified by independent engines before public 
   disclosure. This ensures the integrity of the scientific claim.
